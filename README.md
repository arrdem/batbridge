# Batbridge simulator set

This library contains the source code written in support of my "building a modern
processor" post sequence over at [arrdem.com](http://arrdem.com). The various
posts aim to demonstrate basic processor design models, as well as
[clojure.core.typed](https://github.com/clojure/core.typed) and
[toothpick](https://github.com/arrdem/toothpick).
