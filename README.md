# BatBridge

This library contains the sourcecode written in support of my "building a modern
processor" post sequence over at [arrdem.com](http://arrdem.com). The various
posts aim to demonstrait basic processor design models, as well as
[clojure.core.typed](https://github.com/clojure/core.typed) and
[toothpick](https://github.com/arrdem/toothpick).

[The full BatBridge specification](doc/batbridge.md)

 1. [A single cycle processor](http://arrdem.com/2013/11/03/a-single-cycle-processor.html)
 2. [A pipelined processor]()
 3. Typing the single cycle processor [TODO]
 4. An out of order processor [TODO]
 5. Toothpick and bytecode simulation [TODO]
